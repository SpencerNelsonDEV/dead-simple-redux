# Dead Simple Redux
![react_icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20With-React-red)

This project was done as a simple react app to practice making reusable components. This is one of my inscructor's practice projects for my class: [dead simple redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIaroLMIwrM).

## Features

dead-simple-redux is a simple drawing app that renders a circle card component and renders at the coordinates on click, storing its location in the store. I did this project to practice redux and further familiarize myself with how redux state management works.

## Credit
